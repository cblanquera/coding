# ChrisAI Router

This skill is the canonical ChrisAI router.

Use it to decide whether a task belongs to the ChrisAI documentation, coding,
QA, or design skill family, then hand the work to the narrowest matching
specialist skill.

Do not duplicate specialist instructions here. Route, then defer.

## Routing Model

- `chrisai-router` may auto-route to ChrisAI specialist skills.
- Specialist skills may be invoked directly by a human user.
- Specialist skills must not auto-route to sibling skills.
- Separate non-router categories may exist outside the ChrisAI docs, coding,
  QA, and design family.
- Do not reference or rely on deprecated intermediate routers.
- `chrisai-router` is the only shared ChrisAI skill that may actively consult
  a machine-local `local-environment` overlay.

## Local Environment Overlay

Use `local-environment` only as an optional machine-local override layer for
runtime and executable resolution.

- Look for `local-environment` only when the task likely depends on host-
  specific executables, runtime paths, package managers, browser tooling, or
  similar machine-local details.
- If `local-environment` exists, use it to prefer the local machine's intended
  executable paths or verification commands.
- If `local-environment` does not exist, continue silently with normal
  behavior.
- Do not ask the user about a missing `local-environment`.
- Do not consult `local-environment` for pure documentation, conceptual, or
  routing-only work.
- Do not force specialist skills to repeat this lookup unless they are invoked
  directly and runtime resolution is actually needed.

## Documentation Routes

Choose exactly one documentation specialist unless the task clearly needs a
deliberate sequence.

- Use `chrisai-docs-dev-api-reference` for API pages, module/class/function
  reference docs, config docs, and lookup-oriented examples.
- Use `chrisai-docs-dev-onboarding` for quick starts, tutorials, conceptual
  guides, and junior-developer-first learning flows.
- Use `chrisai-docs-copy-editing` for proofreading, wording cleanup, clarity
  improvement, tone consistency, and prose simplification without changing
  technical meaning.
- Use `chrisai-docs-dev-formatting` for markdown normalization, structure
  cleanup, outline numbering, TOC decisions, and style-guide conformance after
  the document type is already understood.

Only chain documentation specialists when there is a clear owner plus a clear
follow-up:

1. content owner first
2. copy editing second when the prose needs an editorial pass
3. formatting last if the output still needs structure cleanup

Do not default to multi-skill documentation sequences.

## Coding Routes

Choose exactly one coding specialist unless the task crosses a real boundary.

- Use `chrisai-coding-engineering` when the task is mainly about
  architecture, abstractions, runtime boundaries, framework or library design,
  plugin or adapter structure, API ergonomics, or deciding whether to
  simplify, refactor, or replace an existing design before language-specific
  code-shape details matter.
- Use `chrisai-coding-js` for JavaScript implementation or refactors outside
  React and outside test-specific work, including `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs`.
- Use `chrisai-coding-ts` for TypeScript implementation or refactors outside
  React and outside test-specific work.
- Use `chrisai-coding-ts-logic-review` for review-first TypeScript work where
  the task is mainly about complex branching, decision logic, branch coverage
  gaps, duplicated rules, mutation risk, or refactor opportunities before
  applying changes.
- Use `chrisai-coding-ts-react` for TSX components, React hooks, and React UI
  code.
- Use `chrisai-coding-ts-tests` for Jest, Mocha, Chai, or test-coverage work
  around TypeScript code.
- Use `chrisai-coding-html-css` for plain HTML and CSS in static sites, docs
  pages, and frontend templates.

## Coding Pass Sequencing

When the task is code creation or substantive code edits, route coding work in
two or three passes:

1. if the task is primarily architectural, use `chrisai-coding-engineering`
   first to frame the structure and tradeoffs
2. use the narrowest implementation specialist to get the behavior working
3. run that same implementation specialist again as a final style pass before
   work complete

The engineering pass should shape the design, not duplicate syntax or
formatting rules from the implementation specialist.

The final implementation-style pass should normalize comments, JSDoc coverage,
section comments, formatting, and repo-style structure without derailing
already-correct logic. Do not skip the final pass just because the code
already works.

## QA Routes

Choose `chrisai-qa-playwright` when the deliverable is browser QA rather than
feature implementation.

- Use `chrisai-qa-playwright` for browser QA, Playwright screenshots, video
  recordings, and localhost responsive checks for local web projects.
- Do not route generic coding work there.
- Do not route explicit manual `@browser` inspection there unless the request
  is clearly about QA or capture through the ChrisAI flow.

## Design Routes

Choose exactly one design specialist unless the task clearly needs a deliberate
sequence.

- Use `chrisai-design-creative` for creative direction, visual-system
  definition, homepage composition, brand adaptation, and future wireframing
  work.
- Use `chrisai-design-logo-generator` for logo ideation, SVG-first logo marks,
  concept variation, and favicon-safe logo refinement.
- Use `chrisai-design-asset-formats` for SVG, PNG, and ICO asset creation,
  conversion, transparency validation, temporary SVG prompt artifacts, and
  favicon packaging.

Only chain design specialists when there is a clear owner plus a clear
follow-up:

1. use `chrisai-design-creative` first when the visual direction is still open
2. use `chrisai-design-logo-generator` when the task is specifically about logo
   concepts or logo mark refinement
3. use `chrisai-design-asset-formats` when the work moves into concrete asset
   production or conversion

Do not default to multi-skill design sequences.

## Out Of Scope

Do not route work here when the main deliverable belongs to a separate skill
category rather than the ChrisAI docs, coding, QA, or design family.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer the narrowest specialist that fully owns the task.
- Do not invoke a broader skill when a more specific one clearly matches.
- If the request mixes onboarding and reference, choose the primary user goal
  first; only add formatting later if needed.
- If the request is mainly about proofreading, clarity, transitions, or tone
  rather than document ownership, prefer `chrisai-docs-copy-editing`.
- If the request is mainly about core design, abstraction boundaries, runtime
  fit, framework or library shape, plugin or adapter structure, or refactor
  versus rewrite judgment, prefer `chrisai-coding-engineering` first.
- If the request is non-React JavaScript, prefer `chrisai-coding-js` and let
  that skill decide the right `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` handling after local
  runtime discovery.
- If the request is a TypeScript logic review before code changes, prefer
  `chrisai-coding-ts-logic-review` over implementation or test-writing
  specialists.
- If the request mixes React code and tests, pick the side that owns the asked
  deliverable. A new test suite belongs to `chrisai-coding-ts-tests`.
- If the request is code creation or a substantial code edit, apply the chosen
  implementation specialist again at the end as a style pass.
- If the request is about rendered browser behavior, screenshots, or recorded
  flows, prefer `chrisai-qa-playwright` over coding specialists.
- If the request is mainly about creative direction, visual-system work, or
  homepage composition, prefer `chrisai-design-creative`.
- If the request is mainly about logo creation, logo mark iteration, or
  favicon-safe logo simplification, prefer `chrisai-design-logo-generator`.
- If the request is mainly about creating, converting, validating, or packaging
  SVG, PNG, or ICO assets, prefer `chrisai-design-asset-formats`.
- If the request needs concrete local runtime or executable paths, consult
  `local-environment` first when it exists.
- If the request is outside the ChrisAI scope, do not force ChrisAI routing.

## Review Gate

Do not consider routing complete unless the answer to all of these is yes:

- Is this task actually a ChrisAI task?
- Did the selected skill match the user's real deliverable?
- Was the narrowest applicable specialist chosen?
- Was any multi-skill sequence justified instead of automatic?
